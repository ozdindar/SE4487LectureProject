# SE-4487: Advanced Object-Oriented Programming Principles

## Overview
This repository contains the in-class live coding examples from the **SE-4487: Advanced Object-Oriented Programming Principles** course. The examples illustrate advanced techniques and principles in object-oriented programming (OOP) using Java, providing students with practical insights and hands-on experience.

## Topics Covered
The project includes instructive applications of the following advanced OOP techniques and principles:

- **Method Design**
- **Programming to Interface**
- **Advanced Use of Enumerations**
- **Design Patterns for Object Creation**
- **Stream API in Java**
- **Lambda Notation**
- **Advanced Use of Generic Classes**
- **Advanced Use of Exceptions**
- **Concurrency API**

## Features
- **Real-World Applications**: Examples designed to demonstrate practical use cases of advanced OOP concepts.
- **Step-by-Step Learning**: Code developed live during lectures to ensure clarity and student understanding.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Explores a wide range of advanced OOP principles and their implementation.

## Code Organization
- The repository is organized by chapters, You need to navigate into each chapter to examine a specific topic
- Examples are self-contained, allowing students to focus on specific concepts independently.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ozdindar/SE4487LectureProject.git
   ```
2. Import the project into your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Explore the packages (/chapterX 's) for examples of advanced OOP techniques.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
